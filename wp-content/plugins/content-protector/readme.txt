***Page Builder***
Passster now supports several page builders. We currently support the following page builders:

* WPBakery Page Builder

Warning: Passster currently not support to restrict complete rows or columns in your page builder. It's build as an element/module/widget which you can add content to via WYSIWIG-Editor.

**Pro**

The Pro version of Passster adding advanced features to your content protection.

The pro version of Passster includes all current and future addons which you can find under Passster->Settings->Addons.

***Multiple Passwords***
Add multiple passwords per shortcode. Use the parameter "passwords" and add the passwords them comma-separated.

***Users***
Add additional parameters "role" and "user" to specifiy which users can bypass the protection. Great for membership based restrictions.

***Advanced Captcha and Google ReCaptcha***
Customize background, customize the number of lines in front and back of your code or completely remove the effects.

Let users unlock your content with Google Recaptcha. Enter your API-Key and add the parameter "recaptcha" to use it.

***Link Access***
Use an encrypted link to give your users direct access to your protected content.
